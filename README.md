## Loading Params

You can paste the url params used to query the Deepgram API to load those settings into this tool.

## Visualization

Once the audio is loaded you will see a representation of the waveform and the outputs of the various features.

Any differences of interest will be highlighted. eg. Punctuation is vastly different than transcribed Word or confidence is very low.

## Deep Linking

You can copy the link and share it with others to preload the UI to help reproduce issues. (No audio is being stored so you would also need to share the Audio to reproduce the issue)
